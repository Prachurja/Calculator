# Calculator
This is a simple static calculator made with vanilla JS, plain CSS and HTML.

## Features

It has all the features of a regular non-scientific calculator - brackets, division, multiplication, addition, subtraction and decimals, as well as `DEL` and `AC`.

It is responsive and optimised for touch-device users. They can only change the cursor position and input using the buttons in the calculator. Non-touch-device users on the other hand can type freely.

The `=` button is used to get the result of a calculation. Non-touch-device users can also press `Enter`. If the result is successful, the input area would blink green. If otherwise, it would blink red.
